Foster The Bananas is a team of four developers and Web Development Immersive students from Galvanize. Our application is called GiveMatch, a Business-to-Non-Profit relationship builder.  We are comprised of Sarah Battey, Jacob Crane (both front-end specialists), Malcom Foster and Roberto Santos (both back-end specialists).
## What probelm are we aiming to solve?
The process of Businesses finding Non-Profits and vice versa are often difficult.  On top of the tideous work of finding a partner, the relationships are often strained, they are often one-sided and involve more work come tax season.  We are here to solve that!
## How can we help?
GiveMatch integrates public data about Colorado charities to HUMANIZE the relationships between local Non-Profit Organizations and their business counterparts.
# What does that mean?
